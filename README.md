Project architecture :-
I created django project and apps.
I create django rest_framework Api.
I created slack app account and twitter app account to integrate with them using python.
I added function that listen to a specific message from slack channel to detect word "go".
I couldn't integrate with twitter due to the twitter app requires some days to get approval from twitter, 
that's why i set an array as a simulation for twitter response and save it in mongo DB.
I added Api function to retreive tweets from monogo DB to display it on Angular App.
I crated Angular app to view data.
